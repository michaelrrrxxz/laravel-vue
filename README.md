# NCSAT - Northeastern College School Ability Test

## Overview
The **School Ability Test (NCSAT)** is a standardized assessment used at **Northeastern College** to evaluate incoming freshmen studentsâ€™ academic abilities. This project aims to enhance the current NCSAT system by upgrading it into a **secure, efficient, and user-friendly web-based application**. The system addresses key challenges such as:

- Compatibility issues with modern technology
- Slow data retrieval
- Lack of performance analysis tools
- Security risks during exams

## Features
- **Graphical Performance Analysis**: Uses **Item Response Theory (IRT)** to generate assessment graphs.
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides printout reports based on student performance.
- **Instructor Portal**: Enables instructors to analyze results and adjust teaching strategies accordingly.
- **One-Time Password (OTP) Security**: Ensures only the intended student can log in for each exam session.
- **Optimized Database**: Improves data retrieval speed and performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Laravel 11** (Backend Framework)
- **Vue.js 3** (Frontend Framework)
- **PHP 8.02** (via XAMPP)
- **MySQL** (Database)


## System Architecture
The development process follows the **waterfall model**, ensuring a structured and sequential approach to achieving project objectives.

### Backend
The backend is built with **Laravel 10**, providing a robust and scalable architecture to handle exam-related functionalities securely. It includes:
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
